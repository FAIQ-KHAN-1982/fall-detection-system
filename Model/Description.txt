YOLOv8 Model Training Summary:

We trained our custom dataset using the YOLOv8m model with the following settings:

Epochs: 60

Batch Size: 4

Image Size: 640

Device: 0 (GPU) (ZOTAC RTX 4060 8GB)

We used the following command in the terminal to start training:

yolo detect train model=yolov8m.pt data=C:/Users/xxxx/xxxx/xxxx/data.yaml epochs=60 batch=4 imgsz=640 device=0

After training, two model files were generated:

best.pt – the model with the best performance on the validation set

last.pt – the final model from the last epoch

These models can now be used for fall detection.
