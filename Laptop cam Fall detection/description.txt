YOLOv8 Fall Detection Using Laptop Webcam:

1. Open the code and replace the model path with your trained YOLOv8 model (e.g., best.pt).

2. Run the script — it will start fall detection using your laptop’s webcam.

3. The detection will run in real time, and any fall detected will be processed according to the logic defined in the code.
