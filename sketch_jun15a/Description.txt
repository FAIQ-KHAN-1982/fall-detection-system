ESP8266 NodeMCU Code Instructions (Version 1.0):

1. Open the code and replace the placeholders with your Wi-Fi name (SSID) and Wi-Fi password.

2. Upload the code to your ESP8266 NodeMCU board using the Arduino IDE.

3. After uploading, open the Serial Monitor.

4. Once connected to Wi-Fi, the device will display an IP address in the Serial Monitor.

5. This IP address is used by the system to send fall detection alerts.

6. set baud rate to 115200 (check the code if the baud rate is written the same).

7. search for that IP in the browser and you can see the fall and nofall status.
