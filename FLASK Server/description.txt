Flask Server – Fall Detection Instructions:

1. Open the Flask server code.

2. Replace the placeholder with your IP camera's RTSP or HTTP stream URL.

3. Run the script — it will start detecting falls in real time using the camera feed.

4. If a fall is detected and persists for 3 seconds (you can change this duration in the code),
a screenshot will be saved automatically in the current directory.

5. and also give path to your (best.pt) trained model.
